This repository contains code for implemetniting an LSTM SEQ2SEQ model with attention and an Encoder-decoder model which uses beam search(part of mutual information)
It mainly uses keras, tensorflow and gensim.

#Issues faced:
Hyperparameters were not provided for the networks used.
Lack of computing power: My computer would crash during training so I spent a lot of time optmising my models.
Lack of documented code for policy gradient methods and mutual information in tensorflow.

#Instructions to run
use lstm_w_a.ipynb for the lstm with attention
